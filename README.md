Module 3 - Python
# Election Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was an introduction to taking a csv file and using python to go through directly and populate relevant information into dictionaries via for and while loops.

###Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of the election audit itself was to determine which counties had the highest voter turnout, as well as what percentage of votes went to each individual candidate

##Election Audit Results

The results, as output into our .txt file, are as follows:

Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369,711
-------------------------

County Votes:
Arapahoe: 7%
Jefferson: 11%
Denver: 83%
-------------------------
County with the largest turnout: Denver
-------------------------
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
-------------------------
Winner: Diana DeGette
Winning Vote Count: 272,892
Winning Percentage: 73.8%
-------------------------

##Election Audit Summary
In summary, Denver county came in with the highest voter turnout by more than 3/4 of the total vote. Diana DeGette won by similar margins. This code, as it exists today, should be ready to take on this same task next year with only minor edits made beforehand.
